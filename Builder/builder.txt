The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step.
It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
This pattern involves a director class, a builder interface, and concrete builder classes.
The director class controls the construction process by invoking methods on the builder interface,
 while concrete builder classes implement these methods to construct specific parts of the object.
Finally, a client class uses the director to create the object using the builder, resulting in a flexible and intuitive way to construct complex objects.
