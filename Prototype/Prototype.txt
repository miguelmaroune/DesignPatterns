The Prototype Design Pattern in Java is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object,
known as the prototype, instead of creating new instances from scratch.
This pattern is useful when the construction of a new object is more efficient by copying an existing one,
especially when the instantiation process is costly or complex.
